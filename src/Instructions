The database management system is MySQL Workbench. To run the code it must have a user named “catcafe” with the
password “CoffeeCatSandwich” and have all privileges.There needs to be a connection for host name 127.0.0.1 and
port 3306. There then needs to be a database called CatCafeInfo.

The database needs to beset up. The basic data and sql queries that create the tables are in the project as an sql
file. There is also the trigger that is stored within the database, but the code is in an sql file in the project.

To run the application run the application file. The application.py file will run access the DB with the main file
where the sql queries are.
